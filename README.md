#W2D1 - HW - OMDB Again?

The Return of OMDB

Make a new OMDB app that queries using the s= query (we used t= in the lesson). Rather than returning one movie with a bunch of details, it will return a list of closely-matching movies. Refer to this page Links to an external site.for documentation(Usage).

Render the list (note the data will be different, you'll have to look through it and figure out the keys and values)

Bonus! On clicking one of the lists of movies, have it do a t= search, and render the individual view that you got from the lesson.
